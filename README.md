- **logistics.csv**: Shipment data with carriers, routes, costs, fuel prices
- **sales.csv**: Product sales with categories, channels, forecasts
- **customers.csv**: Customer segments and demographics
- **inventory.csv**: Stock levels and warehouse data

## üîß Configuration

### Airia AI Integration

Both chat features use **Airia** with specialized pipelines:

**AI Chat Tab:**
- Pipeline ID: `0e2a6599-9c5f-40ac-9a39-456a53b7d935`
- Purpose: General business questions and analysis
- Timeout: 90 seconds

**Chat with Data Widget:**
- Pipeline ID: `70ef9a9d-5eb5-44e8-873b-e8060f024791`
- Purpose: Data-specific queries and insights
- Timeout: 90 seconds

**API Credentials:** Configured in Lambda environment variables via CDK

### Environment Variables

Lambda functions automatically configured with:
- `AIRIA_API_KEY`: Airia authentication key
- `AIRIA_USER_ID`: User identification for pipeline execution
- `ATHENA_DATABASE`: Data catalog database name
- `ATHENA_WORKGROUP`: Query execution workgroup

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The development server will proxy API requests to your deployed endpoints.

### Infrastructure Development
```bash
cd infrastructure
npm install
npm run build
cdk diff    # Preview changes
cdk deploy  # Deploy changes
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test all API endpoints
./test-endpoints.sh

# Test chat features specifically
./test-both-airia.sh

# Comprehensive API testing
./comprehensive-test.sh
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Watch Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/insights-grid-bedrock --follow
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/insights-grid-airia-chat --follow

# Check API Gateway metrics
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/ApiGateway \
  --metric-name Count \
  --dimensions Name=ApiId,Value=aij9r8sc8i \
  --start-time 2025-10-26T00:00:00Z \
  --end-time 2025-10-26T23:59:59Z \
  --period 3600 \
  --statistics Sum
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Chat Features Timeout
**Issue:** Requests timeout after 29-30 seconds  
**Cause:** API Gateway has 29s (REST API) / 30s (HTTP API) hard limits  
**Solutions:**
- Simplify query complexity
- Check Airia pipeline performance
- Review CloudWatch logs for Airia 500 errors

### 404 Errors on Chat Endpoints
**Issue:** Endpoints return 404 Not Found  
**Solution:**
```bash
cd infrastructure
cdk deploy --force
```

### Frontend Not Loading Data
**Issue:** Dashboard shows loading indefinitely  
**Check:**
1. Browser console for API errors
2. API Gateway endpoints are deployed
3. Lambda functions are active
4. S3 data files are uploaded

### Airia Returns Errors
**Issue:** "Internal Server Error" from Airia  
**Solutions:**
1. Check Airia pipeline status at https://api.airia.ai/
2. Verify pipeline IDs in Lambda environment variables
3. Check Airia API key hasn't expired
4. Review CloudWatch logs for detailed errors

### Deployment Fails
**Issue:** CDK deploy errors  
**Common Fixes:**
```bash
# Clear CDK cache
cd infrastructure
rm -rf cdk.out/
npm run build
cdk bootstrap  # If first time
cdk deploy
```
